Our Employee Code of Conduct company policy outlines our expectations regarding employeesâ€™ behavior towards their colleagues, supervisors and overall organization.

We promote freedom of expression and open communication. But we expect all employees to follow our code of conduct. They should avoid offending, participating in serious disputes and disrupting our workplace. We also expect them to foster a well-organized, respectful and collaborative environment.
